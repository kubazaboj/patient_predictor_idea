# Project Title

Predictor of patients in a clinic

## Summary

Idea for an AI application to make a predicition for the appointment time of patients in a clinic. AI would predict based on many factors like usual procedure time, chance of complications based on the 
patient's condition, number of already invited patients and their missing rate, severity of their disease, and possible emergency cases. Therefore, this AI would help to increase efficienty and save money of the healthcare which budget is supposed to grow worldwide in the future years.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
Patients in a hospital arrive at the time of their appointment, however, they have to usually wait for a long time before their procedure actually starts. I would love to minimaise these situations by
using AI to schedule appointments and the procedure time, so when a patient has a scheduled appointment at 10.00 for an hour, their time of leaving the clinic would be as close as possible to 11 o'clock.
My main motivation is that I am frustrated especially by long waiting times and people around me are also frustrated by this. Also, as a student in the medical field, I want to tackle present problems
which may not just be that there is not a treatment for a disease xy. Maybe this project would save money governments and private companies spend on healthcare as these expenses are predicted to multiply in the future years.
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
